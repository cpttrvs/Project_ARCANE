# Project_ARCANE
my first Unity personal project - a versus game

* 1 - Find latest stable releases in "/Releases"
* 2 - Download the "[version].zip"
* 3 - Run "Arcane[version].exe"
* 4 - You can configure input and graphism in the Unity Launcher (K is for Keyboard, J for Joystick)
* 5 - "Play" : choose 3 spells using your "Fire1,2,3" buttons, press Enter to launch a game
* 6 - The configure menu in game let you choose the controllers (Player 1 keyboard, Player 2 Joystick for example)
